# [WinBuilder](../wiki/wbindex.md)
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/winbuilder

This repository contains the documentation for the WinBuilder Classic program (still very much in use) as release in version 82.  Originaly coded in fairly flat HTML files, it was broken up and converted to MD format on google code.  When that shut down, it was migrated here to github.

Right now (9/2015) it is still rather "rough", but you can see the TOC and nevigate things by starting with the *[WinBuilder Index](../wiki/wbindex.md)* as stored in the wiki branch.  Main files for documentation have a prefix of "wb", while the function docs are based on the name of the function.  The index file [../wiki/wbindex.md](wbindex.md) should be used as the starting point to navigate the wiki files.
